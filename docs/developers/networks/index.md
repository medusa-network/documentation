# Networks

Medusa is like an oracle that can be deployed to many blockchains. Currently,
Medusa is available on Arbitrum and Filecoin. We plan to add many more chains in 
the near future but we are focusing our effort on making it a robust product first.

## Platforms

The Medusa network obeys events on the Medusa contracts deployed on the different chains.
So far only EVM based contracts have been implemented but in the future, Medusa aims
to support any platforms (think CosmosWasm, or Sui, or even plain HTTP api).

The following pages gives the addresses of the Medusa contracts on the different platforms 
that Medusa is deployed on.
